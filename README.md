 The aim of this lab is to design a RESTful API that allows each IoT enabled water tank to interface with your server so that the measure values can be represented visually on a web page. It gives exposure to the use of HTTP requests using Flask library to perform the actions of a simple HTTP web server. The server should be able to perform actions on a resource such as Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD), this is to be done without the use of an actual database.
